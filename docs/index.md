# Features Plugin Skeleton

Build a WordPress features plugin from this skeleton, then keep the examples and tools your project needs. Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md).

## How the pieces fit

The skeleton is a consumer of shared rtCamp libraries. It owns the plugin's structure, examples, build and checks; the libraries own the reusable behaviour.

| Piece | What it provides | Where it is documented |
| --- | --- | --- |
| This skeleton | Plugin layout, `Main::CLASSES`, modules, example classes, asset pipeline, tests, CI caller | These guides |
| [`rtcamp/wp-framework`](https://github.com/rtCamp/wp-framework/blob/v1.0.1/docs/index.md) | `Registrable` + `Loader` + `Container`, the `Abstract*` base classes, asset/component/template loaders, `Cache`, `Transients`, `Encryptor`, `Logger` | Framework docs (linked from each guide) |
| [`@rtcamp/wp-tooling`](https://github.com/rtCamp/wp-tooling/blob/main/node-packages/wp-tooling/README.md) | `npm run init` engine, `npx wp-tooling add` scaffolds, shared ESLint/Stylelint configs, release scripts | wp-tooling docs |
| [`rtCamp/wp-shared-workflows`](https://github.com/rtCamp/wp-shared-workflows) | Reusable lint, test and build workflows | wp-shared-workflows docs |
| [wp-devtools](https://github.com/rtCamp/wp-devtools/blob/release/v1.0.0/README.md) (optional) | Runtime telemetry over MCP | wp-devtools docs (repository access required) |

## Two ways to work

The skeleton is set up and extended either with **AI skills** (guided: `/init` and `/scaffold`) or the **raw CLI** (manual: `npm run init` and `npx wp-tooling add`).

- **`/init` / `npm run init`** names the plugin and selects which example sets and optional features ship. Run it once per project; see [Initialization](initialization.md).
- **`/scaffold` / `npx wp-tooling add`** adds one feature (a post type, REST controller, block, CLI command, …). `/scaffold` also wires it into its module; with the CLI you add that line yourself. See [Scaffolding](scaffolding.md).

Both are valid: pick the CLI for full control over every input, or the AI skill when you want it to infer conventions, write the test first and run the checks.

| I want to… | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Create a plugin and see it running | [Getting Started](getting-started.md) |
| Understand the init prompts or change options later | [Initialization](initialization.md) |
| Run WordPress, check a change, build for delivery | [Local development](local-development.md) |
| Find the supplied infrastructure and examples | [Included features](features.md) |
| Generate one feature with the CLI or AI | [Scaffolding](scaffolding.md) |
| Add blocks, scripts or styles | [Blocks and assets](blocks-and-assets.md) |
| Extend the plugin by hand | [Development guide](../DEVELOPMENT.md) |

## Further reading

- [Live reload and block HMR](hmr.md), [Tailwind](tailwind.md), and the [Dev Tools demo](dev-tools-demo.md) cover the optional development features.
- [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [maintainer guidance](internal/README.md) are for developers working on the skeleton itself.
