 *      callback for the cron event itself.
 *   2. On the first request after activation, maybe_schedule() registers
 *      the recurring event with WP-Cron.
 *   3. WP-Cron fires {@see HOOK} on the configured schedule and run()
 *      executes the actual work.
 *
 * For plugin deactivation, call {@see self::unschedule()} from the
 * deactivation hook to clear the scheduled event.
