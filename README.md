  The starting template for a WordPress <b>features plugin</b>: the plugin that
  holds a site's backend functionality — post types, taxonomies, blocks, REST
  endpoints, settings and admin pages, shortcodes, user roles, WP-Cron jobs and
  WP-CLI commands.

This skeleton gives a new client plugin its structure, working examples, asset pipeline, checks and CI, so a project starts from a tested baseline instead of an empty folder.

It builds on two shared rtCamp libraries and uses a third for CI:

- [`rtcamp/wp-primitives`](https://github.com/rtCamp/wp-primitives) (Composer, runtime): the registration system, `Abstract*` base classes, loaders and utilities that every class in `inc/` extends.
- [`@rtcamp/wp-tooling`](https://github.com/rtCamp/wp-tooling) (npm, development): the `npm run init` setup wizard, the `npx wp-tooling add` feature scaffolder, the shared lint configs and release scripts.
- [`rtCamp/wp-shared-workflows`](https://github.com/rtCamp/wp-shared-workflows): the reusable lint, test and build CI that `.github/workflows/test-measure.yml` calls.

The skeleton documents what it provides and how to build on it. The framework's API and lifecycle are documented in [its own docs](https://github.com/rtCamp/wp-primitives/blob/v1.0.1/docs/index.md), and these guides link there where needed.

> This is a **template**. `Project Name` / `project-name` / `Project_Name` are placeholders; `npm run init` renames them to your project.

## Get started

Follow [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md): prerequisites, cloning, installing, naming the plugin, and seeing it running in a local WordPress site. It takes about fifteen minutes.

## What is included

- **Infrastructure** that stays in every project: bootstrap and loader, asset registration, theme-overridable templates and components, a shared logger, an encryption service, activation and deactivation handling, and PHPUnit, PHPCS, PHPStan, ESLint and Stylelint setups.
- **Twelve example sets**, one per feature domain (post types, taxonomies, blocks, REST, WP-CLI, cron, settings pages, admin pages, user roles, shortcodes, cache, transients). Each is a working, tested reference you keep or remove at setup.
- **Optional development features**: HMR live reload (on by default), Tailwind CSS, and Dev Tools runtime telemetry over MCP.

See [Included features](docs/features.md) for where each one lives and how to see it working.

## AI tooling

Setup and feature scaffolding are also available through AI assistants, kept in step across tools:

- **Claude Code:** skills in [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/) — `/init` (set up or manage the plugin) and `/scaffold` (add one feature, test first). `/setup` is a generic tooling bootstrapper and does not replace `/init`.
- **GitHub Copilot:** matching `/init` and `/scaffold` prompts in [`.github/prompts/`](.github/prompts/).
- **Any assistant:** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the tool-agnostic source of conventions; `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` point to it.

A committed knowledge graph in [`graphify-out/`](graphify-out/) lets assistants query the code's structure instead of reading it all; see [docs/internal/knowledge-graph.md](docs/internal/knowledge-graph.md).

Some of these folders hold examples that initialization can remove; see [Included features](docs/features.md#supplied-examples).
